                just a very generic html for testing purpouses!
                The www/ directory was inspired by apache2,
                TO BE HONEST all of it was inspired by apache.
                im trying to make thigs as <s>standart</s> easy as i can :p
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, i even got a proper css and background,
                my ancient html skills came in handy (impossible).
                I got this background from the azumanga daioh outro because i thought
                it looked quite fitting.
