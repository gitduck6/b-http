# B-http
A basic http server made for educational purpouses in C.
Currently it's uses POSIX sockets therefore only works in Unix-like/based systems.
This program is NOT intended to be deployed **for now** for its lack of optimisation and stability.
# Compilation
Preferably use the `make` utility to compile the program.
# Usage 
To run the program after compilation just run ./server
Right now there are not many modifications the user can make. (just the server.conf file)
# Contributing
Pull requests are really appreciated. But for major changes please consider opening an issue first.
I am quite inexperienced so please forgive me in advance if I cause you any frustrations.
